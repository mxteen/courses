    "\n",
    "In the data-driven world, data scientists have emerged as a hot commodity. The chase is on to find the best talent in data science. Already, experts estimate that millions of jobs in data science might remain vacant for the lack of readily available talent. The global search for skilled data scientists is not merely a search for statisticians or computer scientists. In fact, the firms are searching for well-rounded individuals who possess the subject matter expertise, some experience in software programming and analytics, and exceptional communication skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our digital footprint has expanded rapidly over the past 10 years. The size of the digital universe was roughly 130 billion gigabytes in 1995. By 2020, this number will swell to 40 trillion gigabytes. Companies will compete for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of new workers needed to navigate the digital world. No wonder the prestigious Harvard Business Review called data science the sexiest job in the 21st century.\n",
    "\n",
    "A report by the McKinsey Global Institute warns of huge talent shortages for data and analytics. By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the digital revolution has touched every aspect of our lives, the opportunity to benefit from learning about our behaviors is more so now than ever before. Given the right data, marketers can take sneak peeks into our habit formation. Research in neurology and psychology is revealing how habits and preferences are formed and retailers like Target are out to profit from it. However, the retailers can only do so if they have data scientists working for them. \"For this reason, it is like an arms race to hire statisticians nowadays\", said Andreas Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is still the need to convince the C-suite executives of the benefits of data and analytics. It appears that the senior management might be a step or two behind the middle management in being informed of the potential of analytics-driven planning. Professor Peter Fader, who manages the Customer Analytics Initiative at Wharton, knows that executives reach the C-suite without having to interact with data. He believes that the real change will happen when executives are well-versed in data and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAP, a leader in data and analytics, reported from a survey that 92% of the responding firms in its sample experienced a significant increase in their data holdings. At the same time, three-quarters identified the need for new data science skills in their firms. Accenture believes that the demand for data scientists may outstrip supply by 250,000 in 2015 alone. A similar survey of 150 executives by KPMG in 2014 found that 85% of the respondents did not know how to analyze data. Most organizations are unable to connect the dots because they do not fully understand how data and analytics can transform their business, Alwin Magimay, head of digital and analytics for KPMG UK, said in an interview in May 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Marr writing for Forbes also raises concerns about the insufficient analytics talent. There just aren't enough people with the required skills to analyze and interpret this information-transforming it from raw numerical (or other) data into actionable insights-the ultimate aim of any Big Data-driven initiative, he wrote. Bernard quotes a survey by Gartner of business leaders of whom more than 50% reported the lack of in-house expertise in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard reported on Walmart, which turned to crowd-sourcing for its analytics need. Walmart approached Kaggle to host a competition for analyzing its proprietary data. The retailer provided sales data from a shortlist of stores and asked the competitors to develop better forecasts of sales based on promotion schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the shortage of data scientists, employers are willing to pay top dollars for the talent. Michael Chui, a principal at McKinsey, knows this too well. \"Data science has become relevant to every company ... There's a war for this type of talent,\" he said in an interview. Take Paul Minton, for example. He was making $20,000 serving tables at a restaurant. He had majored in math at college. Mr. Minton took a three-month programming course that changed everything. He made over $100,000 in 2014 as a data scientist for a web startup in San Francisco. Six figures, right off the bat ... To me, it was astonishing, said Mr Minton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could Mr Minton be exceptionally fortunate, or are such high salaries the norm? Luck had little to do with it; the New York Times reported $100,000 as the average base salary of a software engineer and $112,000 for data scientists."

    "\n",
    "How do you get a better solution that is efficient? You must: \n",
    "- Identify the problem and establish a clear understanding of it. \n",
    "- Gather the data for analysis.\n",
    "- Identify the right tools to use, and develop a data strategy. Case studies are also helpful in customizing a potential solution.\n",
    "- Once these conditions exist and available data is extracted, you can develop a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So structured data is more like tabular data things that you’re familiar with in Microsoft Excel format. You've got rows and columns and that's called structured data. Unstructured data is basically data that is coming from mostly from web where it's not tabular. It is not, it's not in rows and columns. It's text. It's sometimes it's video and audio, so you would have to deploy more sophisticated algorithms to extract data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud is a godsend for data scientists**. Primarily because you're able to take your data, take your information and put it in the Cloud, put it in a central storage system. It allows you to bypass the physical limitations of the computers and the systems you're using and it allows you to deploy the analytics and storage capacities of advanced machines that do not necessarily have to be your machine or your company's machine. Cloud allows you not just to store large amounts of data on servers somewhere in California or in Nevada, but it also allows you to deploy very advanced computing algorithms and the ability to do high-performance computing using machines that are not yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can be working with the same data that your colleagues in say Germany and another team in India and another team in Ghana, they are collectively working and they're able to do so because the information, and the algorithms, and the tools, and the answers, and the results, whatever they needed is available at a central place, which we call Cloud.

    "Now that you know what is in the book, it is time to put down some definitions. Despite their ubiquitous use, consensus evades the notions of Big data and Data Science. The question, Who is a data scientist? is very much alive and being contested by individuals, some of whom are merely interested in protecting their discipline or academic turfs. In this section, I attempt to address these controversies and explain Why a narrowly construed definition of either Big data or Data science will result in excluding hundreds of thousands of individuals who have recently turned to the emerging field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everybody loves a data scientist, wrote Simon Rogers (2012) in the Guardian. Mr. Rogers also traced the newfound love for number crunching to a quote by Google's Hal Varian, who declared that the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas Hal Varian named statisticians sexy, it is widely believed that what he really meant were data scientists. This raises several important questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it differ from statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes someone a data scientist?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the times of big data, a question as simple as, What is data science? can result in many answers. In some cases, the diversity of opinion on these answers borders on hostility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I define a data scientist as someone who finds solutions to problems by analyzing Big or small data using appropriate tools and then tells stories to communicate her findings to the relevant stakeholders**. I do not use the data size as a restrictive clause. A data below a certain arbitrary threshold does not make one less of a data scientist. Nor is my definition of a data scientist restricted to particular analytic tools, such as machine learning. **As long as one has a curious mind, fluency in analytics, and the ability to communicate the findings, I consider the person a data scientist.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**I define data science as something that data scientists do**. Years ago, as an engineering student at the University of Toronto, I was stuck With the question: What is engineering? I wrote my master's thesis on forecasting housing prices and my doctoral dissertation on forecasting homebuilders' choices related to What they build, when they build, and where they build new housing. In the civil engineering department, Others were working on designing buildings, bridges, tunnels, and worrying about the stability of slopes. My work, and that of my supervisor, was not your traditional garden-variety engineering. Obviously, I was repeatedly asked by others whether my research was indeed engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I shared these concerns with my doctoral supervisor, Professor Eric Miller, he had a laugh. Dr Miller spent a lifetime researching urban land use and transportation and had earlier earned a doctorate from MIT. \"Engineering is what engineers do,\" he responded. Over the next 17 years, I realized the wisdom in his statement. You first become an engineer by obtaining a degree and then registering with the local professional body that regulates the engineering profession. Now you are an engineer. You can dig tunnels; write software codes; design components of an iPhone or a supersonic jet. You are an engineer. And when you are leading the global response to a financial crisis in your role as the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as Dr Raghuram Rajan did, you are an engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Raghuram Rajan did his first degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology. He pursued economics in graduate studies, later became a professor at a prestigious university, and eventually landed at the IMF. He is currently serving as the 23rd Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Could someone argue that his intellectual prowess is rooted only in his training as an economist and that the fundamentals he learned as an engineering student played no role in developing his problem-solving abilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Rajan is an engineer. So are Xi Jinping, the President of the People's Republic of China, and Alexis Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister who is forcing the world to rethink the fundamentals of global economics. They might not be designing new circuitry, distillation equipment, or bridges, but they are helping build better societies and economies and there can be no better definition of engineering and engineers—that is, individuals dedicated to building better economies and societies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So briefly, I would argue that data science is what data scientists do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Others have many different definitions. In September 2015, a co-panelist at a meetup organized by BigDataUniversity.com in Toronto confined data science to machine learning. There you have it. If you are not using the black boxes that makeup machine learning, as per some experts in the field, you are not a data scientist. Even if you were to discover the cure to a disease threatening the lives of millions, turf-protecting colleagues will exclude you from the data science club.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr Vincent Granville (2014), an author on data science, offers certain thresholds to meet to be a data scientist. On pages 8 and 9 in Developing Analytic talent, Dr Granville describes the new data science professor as a non-tenured instructor at a non-traditional university, who publishes research results in online blogs, does not waste time writing grants, works from home, and earns more money than the traditional tenured professors. Suffice it to say that the thriving academic community of data scientists might disagree with Dr Granville.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr Granville uses restrictions on data size and methods to define what data science is. He defines a data scientist as one who can easily process a So-million-row data set in a couple of hours, and who distrusts (statistical) models. He distinguishes data science from statistics. Yet he lists algebra, calculus, and training in probability and statistics as necessary background to understand data science (page 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some believe that big data is merely about crossing a certain threshold on data size or the number of observations, or is about the use of a particular tool, such as Hadoop. Such arbitrary thresholds on data size are problematic because, with innovation, even regular computers and off-the-shelf software have begun to manipulate very large data sets. Stata, a commonly used software by data scientists and statisticians, announced that one could now process between 2 billion to 24.4 billion rows using its desktop solutions. If Hadoop is the password to the big data club, Stata's ability to process 24.4 billion rows, under certain limitations, has just gatecrashed that big data party.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that one who tries to set arbitrary thresholds to exclude others is likely to run into inconsistencies. The goal should be to define data science in a more exclusive, discipline- and platform-independent, size-free context where data-centric problem solving and the ability to weave strong narratives take center stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the controversy, I would rather consult others to see how they describe a data scientist. Why don't we again consult the Chief Data Scientist of the United States? Recall **Dr Patil told the Guardian newspaper in 2012 that a data scientist is that unique blend of skills that can both unlock the insights of data and tell a fantastic story via the data**. What is admirable about Dr Patil's definition is that it is inclusive of individuals of various academic backgrounds and training, and does not restrict the definition of a data scientist to a particular tool or subject it to a certain arbitrary minimum threshold of data size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other **key ingredient for a successful data scientist is a behavioral trait: curiosity. A data scientist has to be one with a very curious mind, willing to spend significant time and effort to explore her hunches**. In journalism, the editors call it having the nose for news. Not all reporters know where the news lies. Only those Who have the nose for news get the Story. Curiosity is equally important for data scientists as it is for journalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rachel Schutt is the Chief Data Scientist at News Corp. She teaches a data science course at Columbia University. She is also the author of an excellent book, Doing Data Science. In an interview With the New York Times, Dr Schutt defined a data scientist as someone who is a part computer scientist, part software engineer, and part statistician (Miller, 2013). But that's the definition of an average data scientist. **\"The best\", she contended, \"tend to be really curious people, thinkers who ask good questions and are O.K. dealing with unstructured situations and trying to find structure in them.\"**"
