# Description
I have completed the 5-week [Data Analyst Simulator Course](https://karpov.courses/simulator) offered by [karpov.courses](https://karpov.courses). Throughout this course, I gained additional practical experience in data analysis, working with real data architecture and real-time data.

# Solved problems
During the course, I successfully tackled various tasks, including:
* Anomaly Detection: Developed a system that automatically detects anomalies in data to prevent missing critical events.
* BI Dashboard: Built a real-time dashboard with product metrics on top of Clickhouse tables.
* Automation (ETL pipeline): Automated the process of preparing reports and created a script that regularly sends summarized product metrics to Telegram on a schedule.
* Experimental Design: Proposed a design for an A/B test to evaluate the impact of increasing the frequency of displaying advertising content.
* A/B Test Launch: Validated the correctness of the split testing system by choosing an appropriate statistical method and analyzed the results obtained.
* Ad Hoc Hypotheses: Investigated a sudden drop in DAU (Daily Active Users) metric, checked if it was related to recent updates, and verified if all versions of the application showed stable user activity.

# Technology Stack Used in the Course
Throughout the course, we utilized the following technology stack:
* Redash: A platform for data visualization and collaboration.
* JupyterHub on K8S: Jupyter notebooks managed by Kubernetes for interactive data analysis.
* Superset: An open-source data exploration and visualization platform.
* Gitlab: A version control system used to manage project code.
* Airflow: A platform for orchestrating complex data workflows.

Some of the jupyter notebooks and SQL queries from the course are available for reference.
